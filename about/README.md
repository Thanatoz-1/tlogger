## Welcome to tlogger

Here you are going to find all the blogs and personal notes maintained by me for the purpose of sharing with you all. My complete blog is centered over the techniques for *Mastering Machine learning* from a mathematical point of view and to improve the *Programming and coding* techniques with the use of a variety of opensource tools and libraries. 

The blogs and notes will be mostly centeric on the following concepts:

- Linear Algebra
- Multivariate Calculus
- Machine learning
- Deep learning
- Improving programming concepts
	- Using the terminal
	- Managing packages with github
	- github pages
	- other opensource libraries
- Some light weight Python and other language notes.

The folders in this dir are my personal notes that have been written as I study. The notes I have written could be found under my personal github page at [this link](https://www.dhyanitushar.ml/tlogger). In case you find any material that need changes, you can reach out to me at this email with the subject containing *tlogger* and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. 

Hope you have wonderful learning.
